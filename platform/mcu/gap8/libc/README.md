Baselibc
========
This is a very simple libc for embedded systems. Mainly geared for 32-bit microcontrollers in the 10-100kB memory range.
The library compiles to less than 5kB total on Cortex-M3, and much less if some functions aren't used.

The code is based on klibc and tinyprintf modules, and licensed under the BSD license.
